I recently completed a mini frontend task given by Clothzy as part of their recruitment process. The challenge was to build a dynamic product card using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, where users could:

🧵 View a product (Classic T-Shirt)
🎨 Switch between Red, Blue, and Green color options
💰 Dynamically update the image and price based on the selected swatch
🖼️ Use grid layout to align elements neatly
💡 Focus on clean UI and responsive experience

📌 Technologies Used:
HTML5 | CSS3 (Grid & Flexbox) | JavaScript (DOM Manipulation)

It was a great experience working on product visualization and real-time interactivity—key aspects in any e-commerce interface.
